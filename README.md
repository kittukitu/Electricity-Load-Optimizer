# âš¡ Electricity Load Optimizer

An AI-powered electricity load forecasting and optimization tool that predicts future electricity consumption using **Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing** and provides **AI-driven recommendations** for supply optimization, cost reduction, and peak load management via the **Gemini API**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Forecast future electricity load (next 3 periods).
- Detects consumption trend ðŸ“ˆ increasing or ðŸ“‰ decreasing.
- AI-generated recommendations:
  - Supply optimization (renewable vs non-renewable mix).
  - Cost-saving analysis for companies and consumers.
  - Strategies for reducing peak load demand.
- Works via command line interface (CLI).
- Interactive input mode if arguments are not provided.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/electricity-load-optimizer.git
cd electricity-load-optimizer
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels google-generativeai
3. Configure API Key
Replace the placeholder API key in the script with your Gemini API key:

python
Copy code
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY")
ðŸš€ Usage
CLI Mode
Run the script with historical electricity consumption data (comma-separated, at least 5 values):

bash
Copy code
python electricity_load_optimizer.py --consumption 120,130,150,160,170,200,210
Interactive Mode
If no argument is passed, the script will prompt for input:

bash
Copy code
python electricity_load_optimizer.py
Then enter values:

java
Copy code
Enter past electricity consumption (comma-separated, at least 5 values): 100,120,130,140,160,180

âš¡ Electricity Load Forecast & AI Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
Next 3 Forecasted Loads : [215.5, 222.3, 229.1]
Trend                   : increasing ðŸ“ˆ

ðŸ¤– AI Energy Optimization & Cost Analysis:
- Shift high-consumption activities to off-peak hours.
- Increase renewable integration (solar/wind during daytime).
- Use demand-response incentives to reduce peak load.
- Consumers can save ~10-15% with smart appliances & load shifting.
ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
Add seasonal forecasting (e.g., daily/weekly patterns).

Plot forecast trends with matplotlib.

Export forecast results and AI recommendations to CSV/JSON.

Deploy as a Flask web app for interactive use.
